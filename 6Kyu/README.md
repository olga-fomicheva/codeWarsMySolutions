## Tribonacci Sequence
Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.
As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. 
Examples:
[1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]
[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]
So, you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.
Signature will always contain 3 numbers; 
n will always be a non-negative number; if n == 0, then return an empty array.

##Kebabize
Modify the kebabize function so that it converts a camel case string into a kebab case.
Examples:
kebabize('camelsHaveThreeHumps') // camels-have-three-humps
kebabize('camelsHave3Humps') // camels-have-humps
Notes:
the returned string should only contain lowercase letters

##Delete occurrences of an element if it occurs more than n times
Alice and Bob were on a holiday. Both of them took many pictures of the places they've been, and now they want to show Charlie their entire collection. 
However, Charlie doesn't like this sessions, since the motive usually repeats. He isn't fond of seeing the Eiffel tower 40 times. 
He tells them that he will only sit during the session if they show the same motive at most N times. Luckily, Alice and Bob are able to encode the motive as a number. 
Can you help them to remove numbers such that their list contains each number only up to N times, without changing the order?

Task
Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list that contains each number of lst at most N times without reordering. For example if N = 2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].

Example
  delete_nth ([1,1,1,1],2) # return [1,1]
  delete_nth ([20,37,20,21],1) # return [20,37,21]
  
##Find the missing letter
Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters as input and that returns the missing letter in the array.

You will always get an valid array. And it will be always exactly one letter be missing. The length of the array will always be at least 2.
The array will always contain letters in only one case.

Example:

['a','b','c','d','f'] -> 'e'
['O','Q','R','S'] -> 'P'
(Use the English alphabet with 26 letters!)

##Replace With Alphabet Position
Welcome.
In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.
If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.
"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

Example
alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" (as a string)


##Vasya - Clerk
The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollars bill. 
An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.
Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.
Can Vasya sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people follow in the line?

Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to each person and give the change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.

Examples:
tickets([25, 25, 50]) # => YES 
tickets([25, 100]) # => NO. Vasya will not have enough money to give change to 100 dollars
tickets([25, 25, 50, 50, 100]) # => NO. Vasya will not have the right bills to give 75 dollars of change (you can't make two bills of 25 from one of 50)


##Stop gninnipS My sdroW!
Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). 
Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

Examples:

spinWords( "Hey fellow warriors" ) => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw" 
spinWords( "This is a test") => returns "This is a test" 
spinWords( "This is another test" )=> returns "This is rehtona test"


##Who likes it?
You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. 
We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input array, containing the names of people who like an item. 
It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

likes [] // must be "no one likes this"
likes ["Peter"] // must be "Peter likes this"
likes ["Jacob", "Alex"] // must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
likes ["Max", "John", "Mark"] // must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
likes ["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"] // must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
For 4 or more names, the number in and 2 others simply increases.
